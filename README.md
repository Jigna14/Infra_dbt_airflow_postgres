# Project: Airflow, Postgres, Redis, and DBT Integration

## Overview
This repository provides a Docker-based setup that integrates Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL with a web UI, Redis, and DBT (Data Build Tool). The project demonstrates a modern data stack by enabling workflow orchestration using Airflow, database management with Postgres, caching with Redis, and data modeling with DBT. Example DAGs showcase how to trigger DBT model builds using Airflow.
